# Introduction to Data Competitions

This 


**Prerequisites**

This material should be accessible to people familiar with basic Python, but not necessarily the libraries we will use, like Astropy or Pandas.  If you are familiar with Python lists and dictionaries, and you know how to write a function that takes parameters and returns a value, that should be enough.

We assume that you are familiar with astronomy at the undergraduate level, but we will not assume specialized knowledge of the datasets or analysis methods we'll use.
