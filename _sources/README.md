# Introduction to Data Competitions

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and other material for an introduction to machine learning competitions using
Scikit-learn.
As a motivating exercise, we will participate in a data science competition hosted by DrivenData, called [Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/).

The goal of this competition is to use survey data to predict which people chose to get vaccinated against H1N1,
which is the influenza virus that caused the [2009 swine flu pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic).

The dataset we will use is from the [National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nis/data_files_h1n1.htm), which ran from October 2009 through June 2010.
As we explore the data, we will get a better sense of the information it contains and how it can be useful.
The primary tools we will use are:

* Pandas for reading and exploring data, and

* Scikit-learn for processing data, making models, and generating predictions.

In the first lesson, we will use a relatively simple algorithm to generate predictions, submit the predictions to the competition site, and get a score.
In the subsequent lessons we will gradually add new features and improve the model.
The third lesson ends with an open-ended exercise where you can explore on your own and see if you can move up the leaderboard.

**Prerequisites**

This tutorial should be accessible to people familiar with intermediate-level Python including NumPy and Pandas, but no prior experience with Scikit-learn is required.
And you don't have to know anything about machine learning.
